            My name is Juril, and I am a product designer, UI engineer, front-end designer,
            design engineer, and whatever the hell you want to call it. Basically, I design
            stuff and code the front-front-end of said stuff.

            As a design-minded developer, I'm very keen on writing HTML, CSS, and
            presentational Javascript with semantics, responsiveness, accessibility,
            and performance in mind.

            All that aside, I'm a developer based in Cebu, Philippines. Currently into
            mechanical keyboards and small form factor PCs when not coding.
